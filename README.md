This retro, Fallout-inspired terminal is designed to be quick, light and fun to 
use. Future version will elaborate on the security front.
Type your password with arrow keys in a screen with characters in randomized order
to avoid keystrokes spying malware to observing your password.

There already exists different and working software for protecting your data, so 
one would think, "Why then?". First, it's fun to use, and that's good enough. Second, 
the idea of creating another layer of protection against keystrokes espionage is 
interesting in on itself.
